\title{Male \code{Gammarus fossarum} exposed to Hg spiked water.
Three exposure concentrations were tested in triplicates. The duration of the
accumulation phase is 4 days for 0.0000708021 and 0.000283208
\eqn{\mu g.m L^{-1}} exposure concentrations, and 7 days for 0.000141604
\eqn{\mu g.m L^{-1}} exposure concentration.}
\format{
A dataframe with 72 observations on the following four variables:
\describe{
\item{\code{time}}{A vector of class \code{numeric} with the time points in
days.}
\item{\code{expw}}{A vector of class \code{numeric} with Hg
exposure in water in \eqn{\mu g.m L^{-1}}.}
\item{\code{replicate}}{A vector of class \code{integer} for replicate
