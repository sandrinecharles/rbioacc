days.}
\item{\code{expw}}{A vector of class \code{numeric} with seanine
exposure in water in \eqn{\mu g.m L^{-1}}.}
\item{\code{replicate}}{A vector of class \code{integer} for replicate
identification.}
\item{\code{conc}}{A vector of class \code{numeric} with concentration
in organism.}
\item{\code{concm1}}{A vector of class \code{numeric} with metabolite
concentration in organism.}
\item{\code{concm2}}{A vector of class \code{numeric} with metabolite
concentration in organism.}
